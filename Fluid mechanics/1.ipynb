    "## Venturi Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "![Venturi Tube](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Venturi5.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Venturi effect** is the reduction in fluid pressure that results when a fluid flows through a constricted section (or choke) of a pipe. The phenomenon is named after Italian physicist Giovanni Battista Venturi (1746â€“1822), who first described it in 1797.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram above illustrates the principle of the Venturi effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constriction:** The fluid (represented by the blue arrows) flows through a pipe that narrows at the center, creating a constriction in the flow.\n",
    "- **Pressure Difference:** As the fluid passes through the narrow section, its velocity increases, and according to Bernoulli's principle, its pressure decreases.\n",
    "- **Flow Regeneration:** After passing through the constriction, the fluid returns to its original diameter, and its velocity and pressure return to their original values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The Venturi effect has several practical applications in various fields, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Carburetors:** In internal combustion engines, the Venturi effect is used in carburetors to mix air and fuel efficiently.\n",
    "- **Aircraft Design:** It is used in the design of aircraft wings to generate lift.\n",
    "- **Medical Devices:** The Venturi effect is utilized in medical devices such as oxygen masks and nebulizers to control the flow of gases and liquids.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in pressure due to the Venturi effect can be calculated using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\Delta P = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 \\left( \\frac{{A_1^2 - A_2^2}}{{A_1^2}} \\right)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( \\Delta P \\) is the pressure difference,\n",
    "- \\( \\rho \\) is the fluid density,\n",
    "- \\( v \\) is the fluid velocity,\n",
    "- \\( A_1 \\) is the area of the wider section of the pipe, and\n",
    "- \\( A_2 \\) is the area of the narrower section of the pipe.\n"
